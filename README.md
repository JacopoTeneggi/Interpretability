## Aim 
Study and compare various methods to produce saliency maps on a synthetic dataset. These methods are ueful in understanding what parts of an image are important for predictions made by a neural network. 
Present a modified version of the SHAP method, which functions in a recursive and hierarchical manner to produce exact Shapley coefficients.
